# Module 1: Bitcoin & Blockchain

## What is a Blokchain?

* Blockchain enables peer to peer transfer of digital assets without any intermediaries
* Technology originally created to support the famous cryptocurrency. Ex: Bitcoin
* The blockchain is posed to innovate and transform a wide range of applications
  * Goods Transfer. Ex: Supply Chain
  * Digital media transfer. Ex: Sale of Art
  * Remote Services Delivery. Ex: Travel and Tourism
  * Platform for decentralized business logic. Ex: Moving computing to data sources


* Learning Objectives:
  * Explain three fundamental characteristics that define a blockchain
  * Explain the important features of Ethereum blockchain
  * Explain algorithms and techniques that enable a blockchain
  * Outline methods for realizing trust in a blockchain

## Bitcoin

* Digital currency system
* Autonomouns decentralized application
* Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin
* Peer to peer transfer without a center authority
* Implements software programs for validation, verification, consesus in a novel infrastructure called the blokchain
* What is a blockchain?
  * Enables peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network.
  * Establishing trust among unknown peers.
  * Recording the transaction in a n immutable distributed ledger.
  
## Centralzied versus Decentralized

* Consider a scenario where customer wants to buy an item using her credit card.
  * Let's enumerate the intermediaries involved in accomplishing this task. We have a credit card agency, we have a customer bank, we have a credit cards bank, we have an exchange, we have the merchant's bank, and finally, the merchant. This is an example of a centralized system that we are so used to.

* Now compare this with a system where peers can transact directly with each other irrespective of where they are located. Functions of the intermediaries are shifted to the periphery to the peer participant in the blockchain infrastructure. Peers are not necessarily known to each other. This is a decentralized system. 

## Establishing Trust

* Process in place to validate, verify and confirm transactions
* Record the transaction in a distributed ledger of blocks, create a tamper-proof record of blocks, chain of blocks, and implement a consensus protocol for agreement on the block to be added to the chain.
* **Validaiton**, **veriricaction**, **consesus**, and **immutable recording** lead to the trust and security of the blockchain.
